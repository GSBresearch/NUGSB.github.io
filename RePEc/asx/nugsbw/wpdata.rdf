Title:  Wage dispersion and firm performance: evidence from Kazakhstan
Abstract: This paper studies within-firm pay inequality and its impact on firm performance in Kazakhstan. We measure within-firm pay inequality as the wage differential between the top- and the bottom-level job occupations. First, we report that wage inequality is higher in larger firms. This finding is consistent with the theories of differentiated pay schemes and the scope of control. Further, we explore to what extent a rise in firm inequality affects firm performance. Although a higher wage dispersion may serve as a signal to attract more productive or talented workers, we find no evidence to support the idea that incentive-based pay can boost overall firm performance. The negative impact points to rent extraction by top job occupations.

Title:  M&A and Cybersecurity Risk: Empirical Evidence
Abstract: Using text-based measures of cybersecurity risk, we document that low cybersecurity risk firms are more likely to initiate or be targeted for an M&A transaction. Further, we show that the market has recently started to price cybersecurity risk at the time of a deal announcement and â€“ consistent with this finding - attempted mergers are significantly less likely to fail if the selected target has a low cybersecurity risk profile. Cyber risk is finally reflected in merger premium, which appears to be systematically higher for mergers where the acquirer exhibits low cybersecurity risk levels. These findings offer novel evidence on the economic impact of cybersecurity risk on the market for corporate control.

Title:  The granular economy of Kazakhstan
Abstract: This paper analyzes the importance of idiosyncratic firm specific shocks for explaining macroeconomic  fluctuations in an emerging economy. To this end, we use detailed quarterly firm level data to document that the  firm size distribution is fat-tailed and that idiosyncratic shocks of the largest 30 firms appear to explain  nearly 80% of the growth in aggregate total factor productivity. This confirms earlier research for the U.S. of  the "granular hypothesis" (Gabaix, 2011). Thus individual firm shocks do not average out in the aggregate as is  assumed in most of the macroeconomic literature, instead, macroeconomic questions can be answered by analyzing the  behavior of the largest firms.
