Title:  The Impact of Firm-level Covid Rescue Policies on Productivity Growth and Reallocation
Abstract: We analyze the impact of Covid-19 rescue policies on both firm-level and aggregate productivity growth and reallocation. Using administrative data on the universe of firms' subsidies in Flanders, we estimate the causal impact of these subsidies on firm-level outcomes. Firms that received subsidies saw a 7% increase in productivity, compared to firms that applied for, but did not obtain subsidies. Furthermore, the propensity to exit the market was 43% lower for treated firms. Aggregate productivity growth, a share-weighted sum of firms' productivity evolutions, amounted to 6% in 2020. While within-firm productivity growth was similar for both subsidized and non-subsidized firms, there is a reallocation of market shares from subsidized firms to non-subsidized firms. These results suggest that Covid rescue policies helped firms to sustain and preserve productivity, while not obstructing allocative efficiency gains to non-subsidized firms.

Title:  How binding is supervisory guidance? Evidence from the European calendar provisioning
Abstract: We examine whether banks respond differently to the adoption of a supervisory guidance as compared to a similar regulatory action. By exploiting the staggered and distinct supervisory and regulatory implementation of the European Calendar Provision, we indeed document that while this reform achieved the intended overall goal of reducing European banks' nonperforming loans ratios, its effect materialized during the initial release of the ECB supervisory guidance, rather than following its adoption as a Pillar 1 regulation. That is, the subsequent formalization of this supervisory initiative within a regulatory framework achieved limited economic results, while eliminating any residual flexibility for the regulatory authority concerning the degree to which the calendar provisioning should be enforced.

Title:  Mountains of Evidence: The Effects of Abnormal Air Pollution on Crime
Abstract: This is the first study to assess that air pollution increases criminal activity in a city with air pollution regularly exceeding international safety standards. For winter in Almaty, Kazakhstan, we collect data on crime and PM2.5 pollution across city districts over 8-hour intervals. Our identification strategy employs distinctive features of Almaty's geography: the proximity of some districts to mountain winds and the high frequency of temperature inversions. Using a PPML control function approach, we estimate a PM2.5 elasticity of the expected crime rate equal to 0.38, more than four times as large as elasticity estimates from studies of cleaner cities. Our data and empirical setting also facilitate our identification of air pollution effects on particular crime types. We find that air pollution increases robbery and high-stakes property crime more than low-stakes property crime. These new results support the theory that air pollution induces disregard for criminal consequences and bring further evidence that air pollution induces aggression.

Title:  Wage dispersion and firm performance: evidence from Kazakhstan
Abstract: This paper studies within-firm pay inequality and its impact on firm performance in Kazakhstan. We measure within-firm pay inequality as the wage differential between the top- and the bottom-level job occupations. First, we report that wage inequality is higher in larger firms. This finding is consistent with the theories of differentiated pay schemes and the scope of control. Further, we explore to what extent a rise in firm inequality affects firm performance. Although a higher wage dispersion may serve as a signal to attract more productive or talented workers, we find no evidence to support the idea that incentive-based pay can boost overall firm performance. The negative impact points to rent extraction by top job occupations.

Title:  M&A and Cybersecurity Risk: Empirical Evidence
Abstract: Using text-based measures of cybersecurity risk, we document that low cybersecurity risk firms are more likely to initiate or be targeted for an M&A transaction. Further, we show that the market has recently started to price cybersecurity risk at the time of a deal announcement and â€“ consistent with this finding - attempted mergers are significantly less likely to fail if the selected target has a low cybersecurity risk profile. Cyber risk is finally reflected in merger premium, which appears to be systematically higher for mergers where the acquirer exhibits low cybersecurity risk levels. These findings offer novel evidence on the economic impact of cybersecurity risk on the market for corporate control.

Title:  The granular economy of Kazakhstan
Abstract: This paper analyzes the importance of idiosyncratic firm specific shocks for explaining macroeconomic  fluctuations in an emerging economy. To this end, we use detailed quarterly firm level data to document that the  firm size distribution is fat-tailed and that idiosyncratic shocks of the largest 30 firms appear to explain  nearly 80% of the growth in aggregate total factor productivity. This confirms earlier research for the U.S. of  the "granular hypothesis" (Gabaix, 2011). Thus individual firm shocks do not average out in the aggregate as is  assumed in most of the macroeconomic literature, instead, macroeconomic questions can be answered by analyzing the  behavior of the largest firms.
